# Rust Door Server
#### Oliver Warne

### What is it?

This is the server/backend side of a door management system. A user scans their RFID
card into a scanner built into a door, and it sends the data to this server and the
scanner receives a response indicating if the door should open or not. This part is
the easy side.

### How do I use it?

You don't. It's being developed and doesn't do anything right now.
